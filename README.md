# Dnamic 5S AI Detection System

This repository contains the code and resources for a computer vision system that automates **5S compliance audits** in industrial environments using deep learning. The system uses **YOLOv11 and YOLOv10** for object detection of 5S attributes such as clean, tidy, organized, and labeled.

The goal of this project is to support digital transformation in industrial workplace monitoring through real-time, AI-based 5S audits. This system detects objects (like tables, cables, chairs) and automatically evaluates their condition based on 5S principles.

## Tech Stack

- **YOLOv11 and YOLOv10** – Object detection (Ultralytics) 
- **Python** – Main programming language
- **Google Colab** – Model training/testing
- **Roboflow** – Dataset labelling
